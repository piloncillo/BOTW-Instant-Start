# BOTW-Instant-Start

Use SaveMii WUT Port on Wii U to extract and inject save files: https://github.com/Xpl0itU/savemii/releases

- Extract the BOTW save files from your console (or for CEMU locate the folder where they are stored).

- Replace the original game_data.sav file with the game_data.sav file you like.

- Optionally replace the caption.jpg and caption.sav files with whatever you like.

- Inject the BOTW save files back into your console.

- Open the game and load the modified save file.

Tip. View the caption.jpg files to guide you when replacing and loading save files.
